Description of the game

This game is based on animals’ lovers, as my little daughter. In order to learn about how to write correctly animals in English we have played this game many times. 
The idea of this game is to complete six animals’ words challenge without providing more than 3 letters wrong on each word. 
First you will see a secret word similar like this “ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ “ then you have to provide any letter, if that letter is in the word that you are playing , the letter will appear and then you have to try another one. You must continue providing letters until you finish the complete word. If you provide more than 3 letters wrong, you will lose the game and you should try again.
If you complete correctly the six words challenge, you win and demonstrated that you really know how to spell correctly animals.
To illustrate this, discovering one word it would be something like this:
1.	“ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ “ 
2.	letter E.
3.	“ _ _ _ _ _ _ E _ “ 
4.	Letter A
5.	Wrong letter. Try other letter (1/3)
6.	Letter U
7.	“ _ _ U _ _ _ E _ “ 
8.	Letter R
9.	“ _ _ U _ R R E _ “ 
10.	Letter S
11.	 “ S _ U  _R R E L”
12.	Letter Q
13.	“ S Q U _ R R E L”
14.	Letter I
15.	“ S Q U I R R E L”
16.	You got it!

Can you use this code and implement these rules in the game.
